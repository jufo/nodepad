Nodepad
=======

This is my copy of the nodepad tutorial from dailyjs.com.

Part 1
------

Ended up using sudo to install the npm modules (sort this out later).
Needed to add ~/node_modules/.bin to my PATH.

Then creating the application using express worked fine.

Mongoose has changed a lot. Referred to Part 12 to see what changes Alex had made.
What I have here is simpler.
